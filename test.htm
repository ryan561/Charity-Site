<h3 style="font-size:30px";>Ending Homelessness</h3>





<p style="font-size: 120%;">In response to the explosion in New York’s crisis of homelessness, the Coalition has grown and evolved to meet the complex needs of our homeless and at-risk neighbors while advocating the housing-based solutions that will end this tragic crisis once and for all.
	In recent years, homelessness in New York City has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>


<p><img src="img/staff.jpg"  width="888" height="328" border-style: solid; align="center"></p>

<p style="font-size: 120%;">In August 2016, there were 61,464 homeless people, including 15,501 homeless families with 23,929 homeless children, sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system. Families comprise just over three-quarters of the homeless shelter population.
Over the course of the last City fiscal year (FY 2015), more than 109,000 different homeless men, women, and children slept in the New York City municipal shelter system. This includes over 42,000 different homeless New York City children.</p>

<p style="font-size: 120%;">
Research shows that the primary cause of homelessness, particularly among families, is lack of affordable housing. Surveys of homeless families have identified the following major immediate, triggering causes of homelessness: eviction; doubled-up or severely overcrowded housing; domestic violence; job loss; and hazardous housing conditions
</p>

<p style="font-size: 120%;">
 Pioneered in New York City in the 1980s, permanent supportive housing has now proven to be a successful and cost-effective solution to the homelessness crisis. The supportive housing model combines affordable housing assistance with vital support services for individuals living with mental illness, HIV/AIDS or other serious health problems. Moreover, numerous research studies have shown that permanent supportive housing costs less than other forms of emergency and institutional care. The landmark 1990 City-State “New York/New York Agreement,” which has been renewed twice, is the premier example of a permanent supportive housing initiative that successfully reduced homelessness in New York City and saved taxpayer dollars that would otherwise have been spent on costly shelters and hospitalizations.
